# POSTQUEUE WRAPPER
Main objective is to create a list of ID that can be later pased to postsuper for processing.

Basic search functionality is providewd and it is possible to output verbosely (shows the entire contents of the matched postqueue -p entry).

## Pending fixes
- Put code inside functions
- Test if rawInput is out of range
- Enhance search to include/exclude/patterns
